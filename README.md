<h2 align="center">Purpose of the task</h2>
<p> The primary purpose of the program I have written is to develop programming skills and increase experience in programming in Python using the tools listed in the project title. <p>


<h1 align="center">**Phone Number Finder</a>**</h1>  
  
## Technologies:
<ul>
<li><p>Python 3.9</p></li>
<li><p>PyCharm</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu</p></li>
<li><p>Flask</p></li>
</ul>

## Use of the programme:
<p>The number of random numbers is limited, you can change this parameter in app.py / index. User sends query if given number is on the page and gets answer. The basic task is to work with Flask, while the frontend I made is to allow the user to ask for the phone number, not the purpose of the website itself, hence its functionality and scalability has been limited. n</p>
